# RockMan-PET

I'm a MegaMan Battle Network nerd, so I did something with that.

This repository contains a vanilla PET overlay, a MegaMan "edition" PET overlay, and for those who like the Gameboy Advance SP and/or Gameboy micro overlays, there's a little somethin' special for you too.

# PET Overlays

# File Placement

NOTE: You can put these wherever you want, so long as you are able to easily navigate to them within retroarch's settings and so long as they're not with any sensitive files that are crucial to retroarch or your Anbernic device. Otherwise, it may be best to use my recommended defaults locations.

Move the **OtterBot** folder to `mmc > MUOS > retorach > overlays`

# Gameboy Advance SP/Gameboy micro Configuration
Open a GBA game, then the Quick Menu, and go back to the main menu. Then go to `Settings > Video > Scaling`.

Integer Scale: **Off**

Aspect Ratio: **Custom**

Custom Aspect Ratio (X Position): **0**

Custom Aspect Ratio (Y Position): **0**

Custom Aspect Ratio (Width): **640**

Custom Aspect Ratio (Height): **426**

Bilinear Filtering: **OFF**

Crop Overscan: **ON**

# Gameboy Advance SP/Gameboy micro Usage
While playing a game, open the quick menu and go to `On-Screen Overlay > Overlay Preset`.

Select **Parent Directory** until you get to the directory that contains the folder named **OtterBot**. Then go to `OtterBot > gba > PET` or `OtterBot > micro > PET` and pick the overlay you'd prefer.

Go back to the Quick Menu and then go to **Overrides**.

If you want the selected bezel for all GBA games, select **Save Content Directory Overrides**.

If you want the selected bezel for just the current GBA game, select **Save Game Overrides**.
